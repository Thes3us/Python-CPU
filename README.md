# PyCPU
A turing complete CPU that can interpret assembly. It is purposefully made to mimick low level interaction in a real CPU. It Has an ALU, CU, 7 registers of 1 byte, an output. Please refer (Instruction)(Instructions.md) to learn to write your own assembly or binary. Heavily inspired from OVERTURE architechture from the game "Turing complete"
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Git

    cd PyCPU
    ```
2. **Run cpu.py**
    ```sh
    python cpu.py
    ```
## Additional info
You may write your own assembly as a text file or `.asm`. There is a demo program to print first 10 natural number in `print10num.asm`
